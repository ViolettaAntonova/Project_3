# Requirements
# Data and Delivery:

 - Data components used in the project are clearly documented.
 - The dataset contains at least 100 unique records. 
 - A database is used to house the data (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
 - The project is powered by a Python Flask API and includes HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and the chosen database. 

# Back End 

 - The page created to showcase data visualizations runs without error. 
 - A JavaScript library not shown in class is used in the project. 
 - The project conforms to one of the following designs: 
 - A Leaflet or Plotly chart built from data gathered through web scraping.
 - A dashboard page with multiple charts that all reference the same data.
 
# Visualizations 

 - A minimum of three unique views present the data. 
 - Multiple user-driven interactions (such as dropdowns, filters, or a zoom feature) are included on the final page. 
 - The final page displays visualizations in a clear, digestable manner. 
 - The data story is easy to interpret for users of all levels.
